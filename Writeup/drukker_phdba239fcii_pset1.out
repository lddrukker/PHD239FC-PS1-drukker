\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.4}{We defined a bond's yield to maturity in class. An alternative measure that is sometimes quoted is a bond’s current yield, defined as its coupon rate \(as a percentage\) divided by its current price \(quoted per \044100 face value\). So a bond with a 5\045 annual coupon rate and a current price of \044102 would have a current yield of 5102 = 4.0902\045. Prove that for a discount bond \(i.e., price < \044100\), YTM > current yield > coupon rate, and for a premium bond \(i.e., price > \044100\), YTM < current yield < coupon rate.}{}% 9
